# Codex

A comprehensive collection of programming solutions from my learning journey. This repository documents my approach to various algorithmic challenges and programming problems across multiple languages, primarily C, C++, and Python.

## Purpose

Codex serves as both a personal reference and a resource for other developers facing similar challenges. Each solution is carefully documented with explanations of the underlying logic and implementation details.

## Structure

Solutions are organized by problem category and implemented in multiple programming languages to demonstrate different approaches and language-specific techniques.

## Goals

- Document my programming growth and problem-solving strategies
- Create a valuable reference for revisiting algorithmic patterns
- Share knowledge with the broader developer community
- Demonstrate proficiency across multiple programming paradigms

Contributions and feedback are welcome as this collection continues to evolve with my learning journey.
